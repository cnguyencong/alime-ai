1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Huh?

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The End

3
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Big brother, would you like to have a party with me?

4
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Would you like to have a party with me?

5
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Um...

6
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What was that?

7
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You're looking for someone, right?

8
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
A friend of the party!

9
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's true, but...

10
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Then please join the party with me!

11
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
My name is...

12
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Naruseina!

13
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
As you can see, I'm a martial artist!

14
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm Raust.

15
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm a Chiushi.

16
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Just in case.

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
W-W-W-Wait a minute!

18
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Who are you?

19
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm Amast, a member of the Adventurer Guild Martat Branch.

20
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And I don't care about that!

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Do you know who that man is?

22
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Who... is he?

23
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He's a useless Raust.

24
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What?

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's right.

26
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Chiushi's only use is the Heel of the First-class Magic.

27
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He's been a adventurer since he was a child,

28
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and he's been using it for a long time.

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He's still useless,

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and he's useless.

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I remember that day,

32
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
he was invited to a party called the Heel of the First-class Magic,

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
but he was kicked out because he couldn't use the Heel of the First-class Magic.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Everyone in town knows that he's useless,

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
so no one invites him to the party.

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He's in trouble with money,

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and if he goes to a party with that guy,

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
he won't be able to stay in the Rokuna Yard.

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh, I have the money, so I'm fine.

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Hey!

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Wait!

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry to say this,

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
but there are a lot of adventurers in town who are bad-tempered.

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Don't show off your money like that.

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Really?

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Thank you for your kindness!

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You've just become an adventurer.

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What? You know that?

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, all the equipment is brand new.

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh, right.

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'll introduce you to a good party for beginners.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You'll get a good amount of money if you're a good adventurer.

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Oh, that's fine.

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I've been deciding to have a party with that guy for a long time.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Bye!

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Wait!

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh, my.

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't know what's going on.

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I saw it!

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Wait, what?

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's been like this for a long time?

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You have to be an older brother.

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Here you go.

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What is this?

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's a party's final delivery.

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If you don't submit this to the guild,

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
you can't even get rid of the quest,

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and you can't even get rid of the quest when you're in trouble.

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh.

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I finally met you.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Then, can you write your name here?

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What?

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's your name. You can write your name, right?

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes, I'm fine.

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Here you go.

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Here's your money.

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, I see.

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's a good deal!

79
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Now we're officially partying together.

80
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Nice to meet you, brother.

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Nice to meet you, too.

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The M.A.A.T. is still in the dark.

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We don't know what kind of monsters the M.A.A.T. owners are.

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The reason why there are so many unknown parts is because there is room for adventure.

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So, naturally, the adventurers gather.

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The M.A.A.T. has grown into the largest

87
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and the most powerful monster in the world.

88
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But there are some places where monsters appear

89
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
because of the magic power that comes out of the labyrinth.

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The eastern mountainous area,

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
the northern forest,

92
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and the southern desert.

93
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Among them, the West Forest is a place for beginners,

94
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
where there are only relatively weak monsters.

95
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There are many large monsters, so you can't really meet them.

96
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
At that point, if it's a labyrinth, there are monsters that can beat you.

97
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And if you don't go deep, there are no strong monsters,

98
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
so I thought there would be no problem.

99
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I see.

100
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Well, if it's possible...

101
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Did you say something?

102
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
No, it's nothing.

103
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This is the entrance to the labyrinth.

104
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Then let's go.

105
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh, wait a minute!

106
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll walk in front of you!

107
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What?

108
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm a martial artist, and you're a swordsman.

109
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm the one who's going to lead you!

110
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Well, usually, I am, but...

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Come on, let's go!

112
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
She's fine, but...

113
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I wonder if she can fight properly.

114
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
How is it, big brother?

115
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm amazing, right?

116
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah, I was surprised.

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
He-he!

118
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This is the magic stone.

119
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Adventurers usually make a mold by selling this to guilds.

120
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What do guilds do with the magic stone they bought?

121
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Magic stones have magic power, so they have many ways to use it.

122
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And if you're going to do this much of an adventure,

123
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
it's a natural knowledge to know.

124
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm not good at the science.

125
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
How much is this?

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Goblins aren't very expensive.

127
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You can't get a magic stone that sells at a high price unless you defeat a strong monster.

128
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's true.

129
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Well, this is about the price of today's residence, but...

130
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
How about we go a little deeper?

131
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yes!

132
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'll protect you if I have to!

133
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Don't worry!

134
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That's very kind of you.

135
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Naruseena!

136
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What's wrong?

137
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Oh!

138
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Onii-san, how did you know?

139
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The color of the floor was a little different from the others.

140
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I didn't notice at all.

141
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But finding traps is usually a job of a thief, right?

142
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Onii-san, you're a healer.

143
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I've been doing adventures for a long time, so I've been able to do a lot of things.

144
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, is that so?

145
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Why is Ork in such a place?

146
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Is something wrong?

147
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,920
Ork is a monster called the Demon of the Middle

148
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,020
And the strength and strength of the

149
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:51,020
It's a powerful opponent that's also suitable for the monsters of the virtual world.

150
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,020
Normally, it shouldn't be up here.

151
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,020
Should we run away?

152
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,020
No, I don't think we can beat it if we work together.

153
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,020
Of course, I won't say it's impossible.

154
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,020
If Onii-san says he can do it, I won't object!

155
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,020
All right, it's decided.

156
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,020
It's like he kicked a rock.

157
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,020
But it's slow.

158
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,020
Naruseyama!

159
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,020
Damn it!

160
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,020
I'm going to kill you!

161
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,020
Are you hurt?

162
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,020
Yes.

163
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,020
Onii-san, are you really a healer?

164
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:35,020
I've been doing adventures for a long time, so I can do a little melee fighting.

165
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:39,020
It wasn't much of a thing.

166
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,020
Naruseyama, your arm...

167
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,020
Oh, it's a scratch.

168
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,020
It'll be blocked soon.

169
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,020
No, let's treat it properly.

170
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,020
But...

171
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,020
Come on, show me.

172
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,020
Heal.

173
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:10,020
It's a lot different from Goblin's.

174
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:15,020
It has a lot of magic power, and it sells at a high price.

175
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,020
Well, what should we do?

176
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,020
We've shown you your power, and we've earned enough.

177
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,020
You can go home now.

178
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,020
I'm still here!

179
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,020
Let's hunt some more monsters.

180
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,020
Yes!

181
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,020
The next day

182
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:45,020
You guys are hunting monsters in half a day?

183
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,020
Hey, Raust!

184
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,020
You took Naruseyama to the maze, didn't you?

185
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,020
And this is a lot of magic stones.

186
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,020
Did you suddenly go to the Middle-East?

187
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,020
No, it's not.

188
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,020
He was wandering around the upper layer.

189
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,020
It's true.

190
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,020
I said I wanted to go lower, but he said no.

191
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,020
I see.

192
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,020
He believes you.

193
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,020
Yes.

194
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,020
Actually, there have been some reports of such spirits lately.

195
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,020
What?

196
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,020
Our client's movements are also in a hurry.

197
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,020
I think something is happening in the maze.

198
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,020
What is something?

199
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:32,020
You don't know anything about a person like me, do you?

200
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:36,020
So, you're going to buy all these magic stones, right?

201
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,020
Yes, I'll take care of that.

202
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,020
Yes, maido ali!

203
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,020
I'll get the money ready, so wait a minute.

204
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,020
Amost, you look very happy.

205
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:53,020
The guild staff buy the magic stones from the adventurers in charge.

206
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,020
The reward is added according to the amount.

207
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,020
So, the more we get the magic stones, the more...

208
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,020
My heart will be shaking.

209
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,020
That's why.

210
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,020
Do your best for me, too, Naru-Seina.

211
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,020
What? So much?

212
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,020
That's right.

213
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,020
I'll give half of it to you.

214
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,020
Of course.

215
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:25,020
But, even if I give half of it, the 10 times the amount I've received so far...

216
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,020
The 10 times...

217
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,020
What's wrong?

218
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:34,020
Inazuma's sword didn't give me a fair share.

219
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,020
It seems that it was also quite a trick.

220
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,020
That's terrible!

221
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,020
That's right, Amost.

222
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,020
When the guild is in trouble, you help them, right?

223
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,020
Of course.

224
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,020
If I pay the fixed amount, I'll be in a big trouble.

225
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,020
What should I do?

226
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,020
No, it's okay.

227
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,020
But...

228
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,020
I've already set up a new party.

229
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,020
I'll forget about the previous party.

230
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,020
Thank you very much.

231
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:15,020
Nishiro Yato, Nishiro Yato...

232
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,020
Nishiro Yato, Nishiro Yato...

233
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,020
Amost.

234
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,020
H-Hansam, what's wrong?

235
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,020
It seems that Raust was just here.

236
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:45,020
I don't think he's been to a new party.

237
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:51,020
I don't think anyone would want to be partying in a place where they've been to such a place.

238
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,020
It's just that...

239
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,020
There's a girl who's a bit of a pain.

240
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,020
Naruseina.

241
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,020
I don't think she's a girl with blue hair.

242
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,020
Yes, that's right.

243
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,020
She's beautiful and blue.

244
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,020
I see.

245
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,020
What?

246
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,020
Oh, Raust-san, welcome!

247
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,020
Is that the new party member?

248
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,020
What? You already know her?

249
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:37,020
It's been rumored that the incompetent Raust is going to have a party.

250
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,020
So, are you going to have dinner today?

251
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,020
I want to have dinner, but first I want to secure a room.

252
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,020
Then, talk to your mother in the back.

253
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,020
Room? Are you two going to share a room?

254
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,020
A room? A room with you?

255
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,020
Don't tease me, Mary-san.

256
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,020
It's decided by the two of you, right?

257
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,020
Oh, really?

258
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,020
Since the second floor is open, you can choose whichever room you like.

259
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,020
But before that, you must be hungry.

260
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,020
Thank you.

261
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,020
It's fine if we share a room.

262
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,020
Well, good night.

263
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,020
Good night.

264
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,020
Oh...

265
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,020
Thank you.

266
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,020
No, this is all I can do.

267
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,020
I've decided!

268
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,020
When I grow up, I'll be an adventurer!

269
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,020
I'll be an adventurer and have a party with you!

270
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,020
Don't worry, Raust-san.

271
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,020
I'll protect you!

272
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:21,020
Since that day, I've been training my body to become an adventurer.

273
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,020
For the sake of today.

274
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:30,020
So, I heard that my brother was kicked out of the party, and I came to this town.

275
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,020
I had a party with my brother, and I defeated the Goblins.

276
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,020
It was all for my brother.

277
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,020
Even I didn't notice it.

278
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:50,020
Since then, I've grown taller, and the clothes I wear are completely different.

279
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,020
Above all, the color of my hair is different.

280
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,020
It's natural that you don't know.

281
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:02,020
My brother has always been strong.

282
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,020
He doesn't need my help.

283
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,020
What are you talking about, Naruseyna?

284
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,020
You're protecting your brother, right?

285
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,020
What are you going to do when you're weak?

286
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,020
It's decided by yourself, so do it until the end.

287
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,020
I'm going to go.

288
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,020
But why are the people of this town...

289
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:44,020
They call such a great brother, Munoz.

290
00:21:50,020 --> 00:22:00,020
I don't know what to do.

291
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,020
I don't know what to do.

292
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,020
I just want to protect you.

293
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:10,020
I can only understand the heartbeat of your heart.

294
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:15,020
I can't live alone.

295
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:19,020
I'm a living treasure.

296
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,020
I'm not alone.

297
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,020
I'm on a road of thorns.

298
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:31,020
And we're going.

299
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,020
I wish I could get a breeze.

300
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:43,020
Even if the blowing wind isn't there.

301
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:48,020
But if I become stronger.

302
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:53,020
If I can light up that life.

303
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:58,020
If I don't give up, there won't be an end.

304
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:03,020
It continues far away.

305
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:17,020
I believe in the only way.
